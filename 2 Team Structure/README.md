The structure of a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) team can vary depending on the organization's size and specific needs, but typically, it includes several key roles. Here are some common roles that may be part of a CCoE team:

- Cloud Strategy Lead: This person is responsible for leading the development and implementation of the organization's cloud strategy. They work closely with other teams and departments within the organization to align the cloud strategy with the organization's overall goals and objectives.

- Cloud Architecture Lead: This person is responsible for designing the overall architecture of the organization's cloud deployments. They work closely with the Cloud Strategy Lead to ensure that the architecture aligns with the organization's cloud strategy.

- Cloud Migration Lead: This person is responsible for leading the migration of applications and data to the cloud. They work closely with other teams and departments within the organization to ensure that migrations are completed on time and within budget.

- Cloud Operations Lead: This person is responsible for the day-to-day management and monitoring of the organization's cloud deployments. They work closely with the Cloud Migration Lead to ensure that deployments are running smoothly and that any issues are resolved quickly.

- Cloud Security Lead: This person is responsible for ensuring the security and compliance of the organization's cloud deployments. They work closely with the Cloud Operations Lead to ensure that deployments comply with relevant regulatory and compliance requirements.

This is not an exhaustive list, and depending on the organization, there may be additional roles or responsibilities that need to be considered, but this provides a general idea of the roles that may be included in a CCoE team.

It's also worth mentioning that CCoE teams are usually cross-functional, meaning that they are composed of people from different departments, such as IT, finance, compliance, legal, security, and business units, with the goal of aligning their efforts and having a comprehensive approach to Cloud adoption and governance.
